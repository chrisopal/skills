- Scope: `ppt-master-plus-v01.zip` dependency alignment and repackaging.
- Changed files:
  - `ppt-maker-with-svg/skills/ppt-master-plus/requirements.txt`
  - `STATUS.md`
- Validation:
  - Verified source `requirements.txt` and zip `requirements.txt` match after repackaging.
  - Installed updated requirements into a temporary venv and imported core modules including `yaml`, `playwright.sync_api`, `svglib`, and `reportlab`.
  - Confirmed `cairosvg` remains documented as an optional high-fidelity renderer because it needs the native Cairo library in addition to the pip package.
  - Tested `/Users/guojiexie/Development/skills/ppt-master-plus-v01.zip` with `unzip -t`.
  - Confirmed the zip excludes `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, and `.pyc`.
- Commit/push policy:
  - Requirements source changes are committed and pushed.
  - The regenerated zip remains a local distribution artifact and is intentionally uncommitted.
